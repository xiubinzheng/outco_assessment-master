 # Problem: Mergesort or Quicksort

 # In this problem, implement either mergesort or quicksort

 # For your help, we have supplied a million-element array of
 # unsorted numbers that your sorting algorithm should be 
 # able to sort. 

 # REMINDER: ONLY DO EITHER MERGESORT OR QUICKSORT, NOT BOTH


# test is an array of a million unsorted elements
# run your algorithm on test

import random

test = []

for i in range(10):
  test.append(random.randint(0, 999999))


def mergeSort(input): 
  # your work here


def quickSort(input): 
  # your work here

 # Problem: Doubly Linked List

 # Prompt: Create a Doubly Linked List class/constructor
 # Name it DoublyLinkedList (java/js) or Doubly_Linked_List(rb/py)

 # Part 1: Create a Node class for your Doubly Linked List
 #         Your node class will take an integer value and 
 #         output an object with the following properties: 

 #         node.value: input value
 #         node.next: a pointer to the next node (initially null/nil)
 #         node.previous: a pointer to the previous node (initially null/nil)

 #         Example: {value: 1, next: null, previous: null}

 # Part 2: Create the Doubly Linked List class. 
 #         It should contain the following properties: 

 #         head: pointer to the head node
 #         tail: pointer to the tail node
 #         length: number of nodes in the Doubly Linked List

 #         The Doubly Linked List should also contain the 
 #         following properties: 

 #         addToTail: function that adds a node behind the tail

 #         addToHead: function that adds a node prior to the head

 #         removeFromTail: function that removes the tail node and returns it

 #         removeFromHead: function that removes the head node and returns it

class Node():
  # your work here

class DoublyLinkedList():
  # your work here

 # Problem: nth Fibonacci number

 # Write two functions that return the nth Fibonacci number
 # using dynamic programming

 # In your first implementation, implement a top-down 
 # approach using memoization. In your secon implementation, 
 # implement a bottom-up approach using tabulation

 # Your functions should be able to handle finding the 1000th
 # Fibonacci number


# top-down (memoization)
def fib(n):
  # your work here


# bottom-up (tabulation)
def fib(n): 
  # your work here

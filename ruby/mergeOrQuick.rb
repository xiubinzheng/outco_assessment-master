 # Problem: Mergesort or Quicksort

 # In this problem, implement either mergesort or quicksort

 # For your help, we have supplied a million-element array of
 # unsorted numbers that your sorting algorithm should be 
 # able to sort. 

 # REMINDER: ONLY DO EITHER MERGESORT OR QUICKSORT, NOT BOTH


# test is an array of a million unsorted elements
# run your algorithm on test

test = []

for i in 0..999999
  test.push(rand(0...1000000))
end



def mergeSort(input)
  # your work here
end

def quickSort(input)
  # your work here
end
